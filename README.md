# ProDev Backend Engineering program
## Program Overview

The ProDev Backend Engineering program is an intensive, production-focused curriculum designed to transform foundational coding skills into professional-grade systems architecture. This program isn't just about writing code; it’s about building scalable, resilient, and maintainable backend systems that power modern applications.

## Tech Stack & Tooling

I’ve mastered a suite of tools that allow for rapid development without sacrificing performance.
Category	                Technologies
Language & Framework	    Python, Django
API Architectures	        REST, GraphQL (Graphene)
DevOps & Scaling	        Docker, CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions/CircleCI)
Data Layers	                PostgreSQL, Redis

## Key Backend Learnings

1. Advanced API Design

Beyond basic CRUD operations, I focused on building flexible APIs.

    REST APIs: Implementing robust filtering and pagination principles.

    GraphQL: Optimizing query depth and solving the N+1 query problem to ensure efficient data fetching.

2. Database Architecture & Design

I learned that a backend is only as good as its data layer.

    Schema Design: Normalization vs. Denormalization depending on the use case.

    Indexing: Implementing Hash indexes to speed up query execution.

3. High-Performance Patterns

    Asynchronous Programming: Utilizing asyncio and Celery to handle long-running tasks (like email sending or image processing) without blocking the main thread.

    Caching Strategies: Implementing Write-Through and Cache-Aside patterns using Redis to reduce database load.
